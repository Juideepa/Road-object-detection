This project focuses on real-time road object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) deep learning algorithm to enhance road safety and intelligent transportation systems. The model is trained to detect and classify multiple road objects such as vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signals from images . Using computer vision and deep learning techniques, the system processes input frames, identifies objects with bounding boxes, and labels them with high accuracy and low latency. The project demonstrates the practical application of YOLO for real-time object detection, highlighting its efficiency in handling complex road environments. It showcases skills in deep learning, image processing, and model deployment for real-world computer vision problems.
